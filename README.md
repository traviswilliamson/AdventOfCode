# Advent Of Code
This repository contains Travis Williamson's solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Each year I solve these in a different language, so the child directories will have their own READMEs with more detailed information.

Special thanks to [Austin Owensby](https://github.com/austin-owensby) for inspiring the helper functions.

# Extra Notes
The admin of Advent of Code have requested that puzzle inputs be cached (To reduce load on the system) and not be made publically available (To make it harder to completely copy the site)
